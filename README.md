I'm a full-time iOS Developer ðŸ‘¨&zwj;ðŸ’» working remotely since 2021 ðŸš€

I love to take a project from scratch and develop it to the end by following the design stages. I enjoy working as a team, as well as I can develop alone.
During the development processes, I can not only write code, but also support the team in project design.
In addition to the tasks I take on myself, I also play a big role in the development processes of my teammates.
